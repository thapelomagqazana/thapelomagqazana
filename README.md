# From Blueprint to Binary: A Backend Builder's Journey

** My Story: **
- ### Hard Hats to Headsets:
From blueprints to bits, my journey to code has been one of translating physical structures into the intricate architecture of software. Two years ago, trading in hard hats for headphones, I dove headfirst into the world of programming, leaving construction dust behind for the thrill of building scalable systems and robust backends.

** Current Focus:**
- ### Python Maestro:
  Crafting performant pipelines and sculpting dynamic data structures with Python's elegance. ⚡️
- ### Java Architect:
  Building enterprise-grade systems in Java, where reliability and scalability are the cornerstones. ☕️
- ### JavaScript Apprentice:
  Eagerly expanding my skillset by mastering the frontend and backend dance with JavaScript.

## My learning goals  
- ### Bridge Builder:
  Uniting front-end flair with backend expertise, a full-stack force in the making.

## Open Doors   
Seeking backend/systems roles in Java and Python where I can flex my code muscles and build impactful solutions.
