# From Blueprint to Binary: A Full Stack Developer’s Journey

## My Story:

### Hard Hats to Headsets:
From blueprints to code, my journey has been about transforming physical structures into seamless digital systems. Two years ago, I swapped construction management for full stack development, leaving behind hard hats for headphones. The thrill of building scalable solutions and dynamic user interfaces has kept me hooked ever since.

## Current Focus:

### Python Maestro:
Crafting performant pipelines and sculpting dynamic data structures with Python's elegance. ⚡️
### Java Architect:
Building enterprise-grade systems in Java, where reliability and scalability are the cornerstones. ☕️
### JavaScript Apprentice:
Eagerly expanding my skillset by mastering the frontend and backend dance with JavaScript.

## Projects That Captivate Me:

- Microservices Architectures
- Distributed Systems
- Cloud Infrastructure
- DevOps Automation
- Data Engineering

## ⚡️ Passions Beyond Code:
- Sport Cars
- Football
- Quentin Tarantino films
- Listening to tech Podcasts like Lex Fridman
- Jazz and Deep house music while coding

## Currently Looking:   
Seeking full stack development roles where I can flex both backend and frontend skills, especially in Javascript, Java and Python, to build impactful solutions.
