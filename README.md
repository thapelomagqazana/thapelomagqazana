# From Blueprint to Binary: A Backend Builder's Journey

## My Story:

### Hard Hats to Headsets:
From blueprints to bits, my journey to code has been one of translating physical structures into the intricate architecture of software. Two years ago, trading in hard hats for headphones, I dove headfirst into the world of programming, leaving construction dust behind for the thrill of building scalable systems and robust backends.

## Current Focus:

### Python Maestro:
Crafting performant pipelines and sculpting dynamic data structures with Python's elegance. ⚡️
### Java Architect:
Building enterprise-grade systems in Java, where reliability and scalability are the cornerstones. ☕️
### JavaScript Apprentice:
Eagerly expanding my skillset by mastering the frontend and backend dance with JavaScript.

## Projects That Captivate Me:

- Microservices Architectures
- Distributed Systems
- Cloud Infrastructure
- DevOps Automation
- Data Engineering

## ⚡️ Passions Beyond Code:

- Football
- Quentin Tarantino films
- Listening to tech Podcasts like Lex Fridman
- Jazz and Deep house music while coding

## Currently Looking:   
Seeking backend/systems roles in Java and Python where I can flex my code muscles and build impactful solutions.
